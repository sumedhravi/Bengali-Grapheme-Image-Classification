Bengali.AI Handwritten Grapheme Classification

Optical character recognition is particularly challenging for Bengali. While Bengali has 49 letters (to be more specific 11 vowels and 38 consonants) in its alphabet, there are also 18 potential diacritics, or accents. This means that there are many more graphemes, or the smallest units in a written language. The added complexity results in ~13,000 different grapheme variations (compared to Englishâ€™s 250 graphemic units). The challenge is to separately classify three constituent elements in the image: grapheme root, vowel diacritics, and consonant diacritics.

This repository consists of a training and inference pipeline for classifying Bengali Handwritten Characters.
